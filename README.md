# Feed Reader Testing Project

## Overview

For this project, I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. I used Jasmine to write a number of tests against this pre-existing application. These test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.


## Purpose

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.

Whether someone works in an organization that uses test-driven development or in an organization that uses tests to make sure future feature development doesn't break existing features, it's an important skill to have!

This will help me because:

* Writing effective tests requires analyzing multiple aspects of an application including the HTML, CSS and JavaScript - an extremely important skill when changing teams or joining a new company.
* Good tests give me the ability to quickly analyze whether new code breaks an existing feature within my codebase, without having to manually test all of the functionality.
